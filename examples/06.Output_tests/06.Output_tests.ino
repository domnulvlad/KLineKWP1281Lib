  Title:
    06.Output_tests

  Description:
    Demonstrates how to perform output tests.

  Notes:
    *The connection will be stopped after the output tests are performed.
    *If you are using the ESP32 platform, feel free to uncomment the line "#define KWP1281_FAULT_CODE_DESCRIPTION_SUPPORTED" in "KLineKWP1281Lib.h",
    in order to get descriptive names associated with each output test. This feature doesn't fit on the AVR platform, but you can take a look at the
    "fault_code_description_xx.h" files if you need these descriptions.
    *If you have descriptions enabled, you can choose from a few different languages a bit further below in "KLineKWP1281Lib.h". Please only choose
    one option.
    *If this is left disabled, the descriptions will be replaced by "EN_dsc".

/*
  *This sketch displays information in the Serial Monitor, so another serial port is required for the K-line.
  *If another port is not available on the selected board, the regular port "Serial" can be used, although no information can be printed to it (good for
  projects with external displays or for data logging).

  ***Uncomment the appropriate options in the "configuration.h" file!

  Arduino UNO
    *no additional serial port, software serial is used
    *library of choice: AltSoftSerial (better than SoftwareSerial because it can also receive while sending)
    *pins:
      *K-line TX -> RX pin 8
      *K-line RX -> TX pin 9

  Arduino MEGA
    *has three additional serial ports
    *pins:
      *K-line TX -> Serial1 - RX pin 19 / Serial2 - RX pin 17 / Serial3 - RX pin 15
      *K-line RX -> Serial1 - TX pin 18 / Serial2 - TX pin 16 / Serial3 - TX pin 14

  ESP32 / ESP32-C6
    *has one additional serial port
    *pins (they can be remapped, this is what they are configured to in these examples):
      *K-line TX -> RX pin 16
      *K-line RX -> TX pin 17

  ESP8266
    *has no additional serial ports
    *library of choice: SoftwareSerial (the ESP version of SoftwareSerial can also receive while sending)
    *pins: any unused
      *chosen for this demo:
        *K-line TX -> RX pin 4 (D2)
        *K-line RX -> TX pin 5 (D1)

  Raspberry Pi Pico
    *has two additional serial ports
    *pins: interchangeable
      *default:
        *K-line TX -> Serial1 - RX pin 1 / Serial2 - RX pin 9
        *K-line RX -> Serial1 - TX pin 0 / Serial2 - TX pin 8

  ***If using the first hardware serial port (Serial) (with other sketches), the interface must be disconnected during code upload, and no "Serial.print"s
  should be used.
